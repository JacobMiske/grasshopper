Bugs
----
Grasshoppers hate bugs. The code has been tested fairly well, however there are probably still some bugs in it.
If you run against a strange behavior, please prepare a brief report with the following information

- the platform you are running it on
- the gdml file (attach it)
- a description of the symptoms, along with the relevant part of the screen output

Email the bug report to mailto:aregjan@mit.edu.

Please generate a GitHub pull request if you believe that you have source code changes
to make in order to avoid the bug.
