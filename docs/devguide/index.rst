Welcome to the Grasshopper Developerâ€™s Guide!

This guide documents how contributions are made to Grasshopper,
what style rules exist for the code, how to run tests, and other related topics.

In addition, the Dev Guide serves to brief Grasshopper users on the functionality of each file
in the codebase of the Grasshopper program. For devs, the shorthand for Grasshopper
can be GRSHPR, a recursive acronym for "Grasshopper Realistically Simulates High-Energy
Particles & Radiation".
