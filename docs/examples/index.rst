This page shows some examples of a Grasshopper GDML input file.

Example Alpha Particle Energy Loss
----------------------------------

The world volume consists of Air at 1e-4 atm of pressure. The first red disk is Air at 1 atm and the second red disk is
the detector volume made of G4_Si.

Example Beta Particles in Water Transmission
--------------------------------------------

The world volume consists of Air at 1e-4 atm of pressure. The first red disk is G4_WATER and the second red disk is
the detector volume made of G4_Si.
